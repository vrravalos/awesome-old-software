# awesome-old-software
Do you know the expression "old but useful"?  
Yes, some old software is still needed, but with the inactivity of some projects or dead pages they are sometimes very difficult to find in the vastness of the internet, so I collected them and made them available to everyone here to be downloaded easily.
