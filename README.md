# ðŸ˜Ž Awesome Old Software
Do you know the expression "old but still useful"?  
Yes, some **free old software** is still needed, but with the inactivity of some projects or dead pages they are sometimes very difficult to find in the vastness of the internet, so I collected them and made them available to everyone here to be downloaded easily.
